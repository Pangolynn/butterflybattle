<h2>Welcome to Butterfly Battle!</h2>
<p>The purpose of this site is to allow you to play through an arcade style<br>
  game. You get to customize your own Butterfly Battler to defeat evil enemies<br>
  that get progressively harder as you move through each level. At the end, you<br>
  can enter your name on the High Score table to etch your achievement in history!
